# getting started

To get this running, simply run the following 

## Step 1: Install requirements.txt

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2: Create databases


Create the databases using PostgreSQL with the credentials provided in the settings.py file and initial migrations with the following command:
`python manage.py migrate`

## Step 3: Run server

And start the server with

You should now be able to go to localhost:8000/chat/ and chat with the bot
